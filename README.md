Work in progress. 

Working on a basic drag and drop functionality right now for the tracks, after the tracks get done... lol

Advanced functionality will include selection of UI elements using a EasyMotion like interface.
Also want to use WASD to move clips around. Think it would be fun.

Wanted to make a simple customizable video editor using swing for the UI and kotlin as the backend.
